# This Project is Created on Windows Using MYO ArmBand with MYO-Python
Python module to get data from a Myo armband using a generic Bluetooth LE interface.

## Installation and usage of [MYO-Python](https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/myo-python)
1.	First you need to install myo-python library with the command PIP
2.	Second you need to put myo-sdk into Environment Variables like this

3. You need to run ArmBand Manager and choose to connect the myo 
4.	Then open any of the examples codes , it should run then
5.	Thanks 
The Myo-Python module **only works on Windows**, 
## Installation  TensorFlow on Windows 
Unfortunately until Now TensorFlow supports Python 3.5.x or 3.6.x  64-bit  only on Windows Till now 
I strongly recommend just to download Winpython from [here](https://winpython.github.io/) or [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/files/?source=navbar) Package if you don't have python 3 

Installing it  with native pip

To install TensorFlow, start a terminal. Then issue the appropriate pip3 install command in that terminal. To install the CPU-only version of TensorFlow, enter the following command:

```python 
$ pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow
```
To install the GPU version of TensorFlow, enter the following command:
```python
$ pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu
```

## Installation  PyQt4 on Windows 
1. if You already have PyQt5 just Run :
```python
pip uninstall PyQt5
```
2. download the package from this [website](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyqt4) according to your python Version (python 2 or 3 )
3. cd to directory of the downloaded package
4. ```python
   pip install packageName.whl
   ```
